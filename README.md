# 100 Days of Production-Ready Machine Learning

## ðŸš€ From Concept to Deployment: Mastering the ML Pipeline

Daily log to track my progress on the 100 days of ML code challenge.

## ðŸŽ¯ Challenge Focus

This 100 Days ML challenge is designed to learn and develop production-ready machine learning products. The main focus will be on the production environment rather than the theoretical concepts behind ML/DL models. Heavy emphasis will be placed on ML pipelines and the process of applying ML models to real-world applications.

## ðŸŒŸ Challenge Goals

- Deploy ML models into production environments
- Create robust data pipelines to feed ML models
- Gain hands-on experience with CUDA
- Implement CI/CD for ML projects
- Explore privacy & protection for ML applications
- Learn about AWS microservices
- Dive into deep reinforcement learning
- Explore generative learning techniques

### Additional Focus Areas
- MySQL/Apache Spark
- PostgreSQL
- Multi-modal Systems
- Apache Flume
- Optimizing/architecting software/hardware solutions for ML

## ðŸ“š Resources

### Books
1. Building Machine Learning Powered Applications: Going from Idea to Products
2. Deploy Machine Learning Models to Production with Flask, Streamlit, Docker, and Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform
3. Building Machine Learning Pipelines: Automating Model Life Cycles with TensorFlow
4. Hands-On GPU Programming with Python and CUDA: Explore High-Performance Parallel Computing with CUDA
