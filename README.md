# 100-Days-of-ML

Daily log to track my progress on the 100 days of ML code challenge

## Description ##

100 Days ML challenge to learn and develop machine learning products. Main focus will be more on production enviroment rather than the concepts and theory behind ML/DL models. I will be placing heavy emphasis on ML pipeline and the process of taking an ML model and applying into a real-world application.

## Challenge Goals ##

- Learn how to deploy ML models into production.
- Learn how to create a data pipeline to feed the ML model.
- Learn about CUDA and get hands on experience.
- Learn about CI/CD and how to implement it.
- Learn more about privacy & protection for ML applications.
- Learn more about AWS microservices.
- Learn more about deep reinforcement Learning.
- Learn more about generative Learning.

## Daily Goals ##

<h3>Day 1: Deploy a linear Regression model using FLASK</h3> 
<ul>
    <li>Develop a web app using FLASK</li>
    <li>Code a linear regression model</li>
    <li>Deploy the trained model as REST service</li>
</ul>

<h3>Day 2: Deploy a Linear Regression model using streamlit</h3>
<ul></ul>
<h3>Day 3: Deploy a Deep Learning model using Streamlit</h3>
