<!-- # 100-Days-of-ML

Daily log to track my progress on the 100 days of ML code challenge

## Description ##

100 Days ML challenge to learn and develop machine learning products. Main focus will be more on production enviroment rather than the concepts and theory behind ML/DL models. I will be placing heavy emphasis on ML pipeline and the process of taking an ML model and applying into a real-world application.

## Challenge Goals ##

- Learn how to deploy ML models into production.
- Learn how to create a data pipeline to feed the ML model.
- Learn about CUDA and get hands on experience.
- Learn about CI/CD for ML and how to implement it.
- Learn more about privacy & protection for ML applications.
- Learn more about AWS microservices.
- Learn more about deep reinforcement Learning.
- Learn more about generative Learning.

[Additional]
- MySQL/Apache Spark
- PostgreSQL
- Multi-modal Systems
- Apache Flume
- Optimizing/architecting software/hardware solutions for ML

## Resources ##

### Books ###

- Building Machine Learning Powered Applications Going from Idea to Products.
- Deploy Machine Learning Models to Production with Flask, Streamlit, Docker, and Kubernetes on    Google Cloud Platform.
- Building Machine Learning Pipelines Automating model Life Cycles with TensorFlow.
- Hands On GPU Programming with Python and CUDA: Explore High Performance Parallel Computing with CUDA.
